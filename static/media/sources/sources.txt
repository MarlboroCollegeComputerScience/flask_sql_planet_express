I cleaned it up in gimp :
added transparency, selected, feathered, cleared background, 
set inside of letters to yellow, saved as png.

I cleaned this one up in gimp similarly.

Copyright on all this stuff is clearly with comedy central since they
own the futurama series. All the sites above are secondary sources,
copying or reposting those images.  It's pretty clear that for my
"demonstrate a sql database site for a college class", using these
falls easily under fair use.
