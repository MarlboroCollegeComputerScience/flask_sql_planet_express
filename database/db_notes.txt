 PK = primary key; FK = foreign key

 I've adopted several capitalization and naming conventions 
 to try to fit SqlAlchemy & SqlSoup's relations nicely into python's classes.

 * First, table names correspond to python classes, and so are capitalized.

 * Second, field names correspond to python methods, and so are lowercase.

 * Third, all foreign keys are explicitly named e.g. Object.field_id 
   so that a corresponding Object.field relation can be defined
   that returns a SqlSoup Object rather than just the integer id.

 * Fourth, the date format was "3004/11/05", which is 
   not consistent with what sqlite (and other databases) expect,
   which is "YYYY-MM-DD" (ISO-8601). It's been changed.

 The tables and their columns are :

   Employee
     employee_id	PK
     name
     position
     salary
     remarks

   Has_clearance
     employee_id	PK,  FK Employee
     planet_id		PK,  FK Planet
     level

   Shipment
     shipment_id 	PK
     date
     manager_id		PK, FK Employee
     planet_id		    FK Planet

   Planet
     planet_id      	PK
     name
     coordinates

   Package
     shipment_id       	PK, FK Shipment
     package_number   	PK
     contents
     weight
     sender_id		    FK Client
     recipient_id	    FK Client

   Client
     account_number	PK
     name
